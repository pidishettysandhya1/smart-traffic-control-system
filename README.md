# Smart Traffic Control System using AI

This project simulates an intelligent traffic signal control system.

## Features
- Smart Mode (AI-based heuristic selection)
- Static Mode (Fixed rotation)
- Emergency Vehicle Priority
- Traffic Visualization using Matplotlib

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Matplotlib

## How It Works
The system generates random traffic density for four roads.
It selects the road with highest congestion using heuristic logic.
If an emergency vehicle is detected, that road gets priority.
Traffic data is visualized using a bar chart.
