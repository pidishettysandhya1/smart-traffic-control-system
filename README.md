# Smart Traffic Control System using AI

This project simulates an intelligent traffic signal control system using AI-based decision logic to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow efficiency.

## Overview

The system models traffic conditions and dynamically adjusts signal timings based on vehicle density. It compares traditional static signal control with adaptive AI-based control to demonstrate improved traffic management.

## Features

- Adaptive traffic signal timing based on vehicle density
- Simulation of real-time traffic conditions
- Comparison between static and AI-based signal strategies
- Performance metrics calculation for traffic efficiency
- Visualization of traffic signal behavior

## Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
